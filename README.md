# Frontend Starter Kit

A boilerplate for kicking off frontend work, currently notably using [React] & [Redux].

## Disclaimer

Feel free to use this to your heart's content, but keep in mind: This is as much a learning tool as much as a rudimentary starter kit; building the setup from scratch is always the way to go with these things, if you want to improve! If you *really* want a boilerplate, I would suggest the dedicated [React Redux Starter Kit].

## Usage

- `git clone` the repository
- `cd` into its root directory and `npm install`
- `npm start` to start the webpack development server
- Open your favourite browser and navigate to `localhost:8080`!

You can have a little peek behind the scenes by opening up the dev tools, with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd>!

For a more optimized-for-production build of the javascript, run `npm run build`. Put the resulting `bundle.js` into any folder with a html file pointing to it.

## Testing

To run the tests, simply run `npm test`.
